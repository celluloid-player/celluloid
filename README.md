# GNOME MPV

GNOME MPV is a simple GTK+ frontend for mpv. GNOME MPV interacts with mpv via
the client API exported by libmpv, allowing access to mpv's powerful playback
capabilities.

### Flatpak

[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) packages support multiple distributions and are sandboxed.
Flatpak 0.9.5+ is recommended for best integration.

Stable releases are hosted on [Flathub](https://flathub.org):

```sh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub io.github.GnomeMpv
```

Development versions are also packaged:

```sh
flatpak install https://dl.tingping.se/flatpak/gnome-mpv.flatpakref
```


### Source code
Run the following command in the source code directory to build and install:

```sh
./autogen.sh && make && sudo make install
```

When building from release tarballs, replace `./autogen.sh` with `./configure`:

```sh
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Alternatively, you can use Meson:

```sh
meson build && cd build && ninja && sudo ninja install
```

## Usage

### Opening files

There are 4 ways to open files in GNOME MPV.

1. Passing files and/or URIs as command line arguments.
2. Using the file chooser dialog box, accessible via the "Open" menu item.
3. Typing URI into the "Open Location" dialog box, accessible via the
   menu item with the same name.
4. Dragging and dropping files or URIs onto GNOME MPV.

### Manipulating playlist

The playlist is hidden by default. To show the playlist, click the "Playlist"
menu item or press F9. Files can be added by dragging and dropping files or URIs
onto the playlist. Dropping files or URIs onto the video area will replace the
content of the playlist. Playlist files or online playlists (eg. YouTube's
playlist) will be automatically expanded into individual items when loaded.

Items in the playlist can be reordered via drag-and-drop. To remove items from
the playlist, select the item by clicking on it then press the delete button on
your keyboard.

### Configuration

GNOME MPV can be configured using the preferences dialog accessible via the
"Preferences" menu item. Additional configuration options can be set from an
external file using the same syntax as mpv's `mpv.conf`. See mpv's man page for
the full list of options. The file must be specified and enabled in the
preferences dialog under the "MPV Configuration" section.

Options can also be set using the "Extra MPV Options" text box in the
preferences dialog. The syntax used is the same as mpv's command line options.

### User Scripts

GNOME MPV can use most mpv user scripts as-is. Some user scripts may define
keybindings that conflict with GNOME MPV, in which case you'll need to resolve
the conflict by explicitly defining new keybindings using `input.conf`. See
[mpv's manual](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#lua-scripting-[,flags]]%29) for
more details.

User scripts can be installed by switching to the "Plugins" tab in the
preferences dialog and dropping the files there. A list of mpv user scripts can
be found [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts).

### Keybindings

GNOME MPV defines a set of keybindings in the macro `DEFAULT_KEYBINDS`, which
can be found in
[src/gmpv_def.h](https://github.com/gnome-mpv/gnome-mpv/blob/master/src/gmpv_def.h).
The syntax used is exactly the same as mpv's `input.conf`. These keybindings are
applied on top of default keybindings provided by mpv.

Additional keybindings can be defined in an external file using mpv's
`input.conf` syntax. The file can be set in the preferences dialog under the
"Keybindings" section.

## Contributing Translations

GNOME MPV uses [Zanata](https://zanata.org) to coordinate
translations. You can find GNOME MPV's page
[here](https://translate.zanata.org/zanata/iteration/view/gnome-mpv/master). To
start translating, follow the instructions
[here](http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/user-guide/translator-guide/). If you'd
like to add a new language, open an issue on GitHub.

While translating, you will find the string `translator-credits`. You should not
translate this string. Instead, you should put your name, and optionally your
email address, in the following format: `FirstName LastName <Email Address>`.
Your name will then appear in the About dialog when your translation is active.
