# Celluloid

Celluloid (formerly GNOME MPV) is a simple GTK+ frontend for mpv. Celluloid
interacts with mpv via the client API exported by libmpv, allowing access to
mpv's powerful playback capabilities.

## Usage

### Opening files

There are 4 ways to open files in Celluloid.

1. Passing files and/or URIs as command line arguments.
2. Using the file chooser dialog box, accessible via the "Open" menu item.
3. Typing URI into the "Open Location" dialog box, accessible via the
   menu item with the same name.
4. Dragging and dropping files or URIs onto Celluloid.

### Manipulating playlist

The playlist is hidden by default. To show the playlist, click the "Playlist"
menu item or press F9. Files can be added by dragging and dropping files or URIs
onto the playlist. Dropping files or URIs onto the video area will replace the
content of the playlist. Playlist files or online playlists (eg. YouTube's
playlist) will be automatically expanded into individual items when loaded.

Items in the playlist can be reordered via drag-and-drop. To remove items from
the playlist, select the item by clicking on it then press the delete button on
your keyboard.

### Configuration

Celluloid can be configured using the preferences dialog accessible through the
`Preferences` menu item. A number of less common options are also available in
the `dconf` database. You can configure these using a tool like
[Dconf Editor](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DconfEditor).

mpv-specific options can be set by creating a configuration file using mpv's
`mpv.conf` syntax. See [mpv's manual](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/) for the
full list of options. The file must be specified and enabled in the preferences
dialog under the "MPV Configuration" section for it to take effect.

It is also possible to set mpv options by putting the options as you would pass
to mpv on the command line in the `Extra MPV Options` text box in the
preferences dialog. If you want to set these options on the command line, you
can do so by adding `mpv-` prefix to the name of the option you want to set.
For example, the option `--mpv-vf=flip` is equivalent to `--vf=flip` in mpv.

### User Scripts

Celluloid can use most mpv user scripts as-is. Some user scripts may define
keybindings that conflict with Celluloid, in which case you'll need to resolve
the conflict by explicitly defining new keybindings using `input.conf`. See
[mpv's manual](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#lua-scripting-[,flags]]%29) for
more details.

User scripts can be installed by switching to the "Plugins" tab in the
preferences dialog and dropping the files there. A list of mpv user scripts can
be found [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts).

### Keybindings

Celluloid defines a set of keybindings in the macro `DEFAULT_KEYBINDS`, which
can be found in
[src/celluloid-def.h](https://github.com/celluloid-player/celluloid/blob/master/src/celluloid-def.h).
The syntax used is exactly the same as mpv's `input.conf`. These keybindings are
applied on top of default keybindings provided by mpv.

Additional keybindings can be defined in an external file using mpv's
`input.conf` syntax. The file can be set in the preferences dialog under the
"Keybindings" section.
